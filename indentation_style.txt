-2 space characters for indentation:
 instead of tabulator character always the same width (with fixed size fonts)
-no indentation for namespaces because:
 -adding or removing an additional namespace would change the indentation of
  the source code inside what produces unneccessary version changes
-function definitions/implementations are not indented (start at colum 0)
