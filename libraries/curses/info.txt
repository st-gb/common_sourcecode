This source code contained in this folder and subfolders should be a common 
to "PDcurses" and "ncurses".

ncurses and PDcurses differ: ncurses e.g. offers menus and forms but 
PDcurses doesn't.
So to provide helper functions respectively wrapper classes that should be 
used the intersecting set of functions of both must be used.
